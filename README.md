# lum.tests-dom.js

Helpers for working with tests that use the (now deprecated)
[@lumjs/dom](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.dom.js) package.

I will shortly release an alternative to this package that uses my new
[@lumjs/web-core](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.web-core.js) library.

## Official URLs

This library can be found in two places:

 * [Github](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.tests-dom.js)
 * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lumjs/tests-dom)
